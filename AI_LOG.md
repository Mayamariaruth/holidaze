# AI Usage Log for Holidaze

This file documents all AI assistance and online resources I used while building Holidaze. The goal was always to understand and implement everything myself—AI was mainly a brainstorming and clarifying tool, not a code generator.

## 1. AI Assistance (ChatGPT)

### Jan–Feb 2026

I used ChatGPT in several ways throughout the project:

- **Brainstorming & planning**: Helped me brainstorm an initial task plan for the project and think through reusable components (calendar hook, authentication flow, booking/venue cards) and keep a clear project structure.

- **New tools**: Guided me in learning and implementing new tools, and finding the right documentation for them.

- **Rubberducking & Debugging**: Explained my approach to ChatGPT to clarify issues and explore solutions. It helped with async API handling, state flows, conditional rendering, TypeScript typing, and hooks integration. I always implemented the final solutions myself.

- **Documentation & formatting**: Clarified my JSDoc comments, and inline comments for understandability.

Overall, ChatGPT acted as a thoughtful sounding board and a way to explore ideas I might not have thought of on my own when I got stuck.

## 2. External Documentation & Libraries

These were essential references and tools I leaned on a lot:

- [Daypicker.dev](https://daypicker.dev/) – Learned how to build an interactive calendar component.
- [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) – For component patterns, hooks, state management, and conditional rendering.
- [TypeScript Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) – For interfaces, typing props, and ensuring type safety.
- [React Bootstrap Alerts](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/components/alerts/) – Tested this for global alerts instead of toast notifications.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) – Layouts, modals, buttons, cards, grid system, and styling guidance.
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) – Troubleshooting specific bugs and implementation ideas.
- [MDN Web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) – JS, CSS, and browser API references.
- **Own previous projects and school teachings** – Reused patterns for hooks, authentication, API logic, React Router, Zustand stores, state management, and Vite setup and more.

## 3. Reflection

Even though I reused some patterns from past projects and school teachings, AI and external docs were crucial for:

- **Learning new tools**: Daypicker, Leaflet maps, and complex state handling in React.
- **Planning and documentation**: Generating ideas for project structure/planning, naming, and documentation
- **Debugging & problem-solving**: TypeScript issues, async API flows, validation issues, and edge cases.

All AI suggestions were reviewed, adapted, and critically assessed. Every line of final code and implementation is my own work.
